# Zairza-Project
It is a Website I made recently for this induction process. This website is based on an imaginative Thrift store.
The purpose of this website is to let users surf Products and buy, to know about thrifting and also contact the owner.
This website is just the layout of a website. It is not responsive and cannot take or store data from the user yet.
 
 ## Description
 * It is only a _Layout_ of a potential imaginative website.
 * The idea is to build a website for a small thrift business owner.
 * The Purpose is to let the user know about thrifting, surf products and contact the owner.

 ## Tools used
 I used VScode to write my code in two scripting languages
 * HTML5 (Hyper Text Markup Language)
 * CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)

 ## Help
 Please open this website on a laptop. The website is not responsive yet and built on a bigger screen, to not face any problems please use 
 a desktop or a laptop to access the website.
